# Dora Vota aMACI Admin Manual

[aMACI](https://research.dorahacks.io/2024/04/11/amaci-adoption/) (Anonymous Minimal Anti-collusion Infrastructure) eliminates the need for trust in MACI’s operator and enables anyone to become an operator for an aMACI round.

By leveraging [aMACI operator service](https://research.dorahacks.io/2024/09/19/aMACI-token-economics/), Dora Vota aMACI allows anyone to deploy and manage aMACI voting rounds with ease. Dora Factory has developed a user-friendly [GUI](https://vota.dorafactory.org) for aMACI round deployment and administration.
