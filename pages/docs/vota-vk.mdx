# Incentivized Testnet Guide (`vota-vk`)

This document is to provide a guide for participants of Dora Vota’s first incentivized testnet (`vota-vk`, a.k.a. [<i>Van kedisi</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Van)).

The purpose of `vota-vk` is to prepare for an expansion of `vota-ash` network’s validator set from 3 to 11.

New validators will be able to stake their own DORA tokens, or obtain Dora Factory foundation’s delegation. In order for any validator provider to obtain delegation, it has to go through the Delegation Program, run a validator for the incentivized testnet `vota-vk`, and demonstrate good performance.
