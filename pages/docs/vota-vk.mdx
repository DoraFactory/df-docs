# Incentivized Testnet Guide (`vota-vk`)

This document is to provide a guide for participants of Dora Vota’s first incentivized testnet (`vota-vk`, a.k.a. [<i>Van kedisi</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Van)).

The purpose of `vota-vk` is to prepare for an expansion of `vota-ash` network’s validator set from 3 to 11.

New validators will be able to stake their own DORA tokens, or obtain Dora Factory foundation’s delegation. In order for any validator provider to obtain delegation, it has to go through the Delegation Program, run a validator for the incentivized testnet `vota-vk`, and demonstrate good performance.

<Callout>
  To register as a `vota-vk` incentivized testnet validator, **please fill out
  the [application
  form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKYDuJxUEx9j-huj1-yqIu5sK3W6X2jbMEO30VIMCHNmtZIw/viewform)**.

## Join Vota delegation program

The delegation program will invite interested parties to run validator nodes for `vota-vk` network. You’ll validate blocks for `vota-vk`, vote for governance proposals, and get gas distributions.

This program includes 3 steps:

<Steps>
### [Application form](https://forms.gle/UxNg7D4Q8M9CoBBH8) submission

December 11, 2023 – December 18, 2023.

### Run `vota-vk` testnet validators

December 24, 2023.

1. If you have already been invited to our Telegram channel, you can immediately start to run your node and sync block data. For instructions on launching the incentivized testnet, please refer to [“Run a Validator”](/docs/vota-devops/validator). It is important to pay special attention to several parameters of the incentivized testnet that are different from vota-ash network, such as **chain ID**, **RPC**, and so on. Please also note that we use the `dorad` binary file with version **0.2.0** in the incentivized testnet. Relevant network configurations can be found in [“Public Resources”](/docs/vota-dev/resources).
2. Ask for airdrop to activate your validator in our Telegram channel.
3. Once your validator is up, add a firewall rule to allow `34.127.117.186` to access port `26660` of your server. Enable prometheus metrics in config.toml. Send your **moniker name** and **public IP** to us.

### Create validators on `vota-ash` network

TBD.

</Steps>

The first delegation program intends to select up to 8 new validators for foundation delegation.
