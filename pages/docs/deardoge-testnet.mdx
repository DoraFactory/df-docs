# Dear Doge Testnet Developer Documentation

This documentation introduces how to use Dear Doge Flatsat Testnet to deploy and simulate applications running in space orbit.

The networkâ€™s consensus protocol can be changed on the flatsat, so that different constellations can be tested. The default protocol is the CometBFT protocol used by Cosmos SDK. However, the [Doge SDK](https://github.com/DoraFactory/Doge-SDK) can change consensus protocols of a Cosmos appchain, which allows you to test various consensus protocols for Dear Doge. For example, a class of asynchronous consensus is of our interest, such as Honey Badger BFT, Dumbo, and more.
