# Run a Full Node

A Dora Vota full node consists of a local copy of the entire blockchain, including its block history and states. Running a full node is essential for participating in network operations like validating transactions, joining consensus, and broadcasting events to other network participants.

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up and running a Dora Vota full node.

## Node configurations

### Hardware requirements

Below is the recommended hardware configuration for running a Dora Vota full node.

| Chain ID     | CPU      | RAM  | Disk       |
| :----------- | :------- | :--- | :--------- |
| vota-ash     | 16 cores  | 32GB | 1TB NVME   |
| vota-testnet | 4 cores  | 16GB | 500GB NVME |
| vota-sf      | 16 cores | 32GB | 500GB NVME |

### Commonly used ports

`dorad` uses the following TCP ports. Toggle their settings to match your environment.

- `26656`: The default port for P2P. This port is used to communicate with other nodes and **must be open to join a network**. However, it does not have to be open to the public. For validator nodes, configuring persistent_peers and closing this port to the public are recommended.

Additional ports:

- `1317`: The default port for interacting with the `dorad` API server for HTTP RESTful requests. This allows applications and services to interact with the dorad instance through RPC.
- `26660`: The default port for interacting with the Prometheus database, which can be used to monitor the environment. In the default configuration, this port is not open.
- `26657`: The default port for RPC. Because this port is used for querying and sending transactions, it must be open to serve queries from `dorad`.

These ports are all customizable in `~/.dora/config/config.toml` and `~/.dora/config/app.toml`.

### Configure chain settings

The following information describes the most important node configuration settings found in the `~/.dora/config/` directory. This is the structure of `~/.dora/config`:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="~/.dora/config" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="app.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="client.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="config.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="genesis.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="node_key.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="priv_validator_key.json" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `app.toml`: Configuration of `dorad`
- `client.toml`: Configurations for the cli wallet (ex dorad)
- `config.toml`: Tendermint configuration file
- `genesis.json`: Gensesis transactions
- `node_key.json`: Private key used for node authentication in the p2p protocol (its corresponding public key is the nodeid)
- `priv_validator_key.json`: Key used by the validator on the node to sign blocks

## Start a node

To instate a Dora Vota node, the first step is to [download and install `dorad`](/docs/vota-dev/dorad) on your machine. Make sure you check out and install the same version as the chain you want to join.

<Callout type="info">
  A moniker is the custom username of your node. It should be human-readable.
  It’s set at the time of node setup and can be used to provide a more
  descriptive and friendly name to identify the node, as opposed to using an IP
  address or a public key hash which can be hard to remember or recognize.

### Repalce genesis file

- Mainnet: Replace the genesis file in `~/.dora/config` with the [Dora Vota Mainnet genesis file](https://github.com/DoraFactory/doravota/blob/main/config/mainnet/genesis.json).
- Testnet: Replace the genesis file in `~/.dora/config` with the [Dora Vota Testnet genesis file](https://github.com/DoraFactory/doravota/blob/main/config/testnet/genesis.json).
- Incentivized Testnet: Replace the genesis file in `~/.dora/config` with the [Dora Vota Incentivized Testnet genesis file](https://df-node-dump.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/vota-sf-genesis.json).

## Configure to sync chain data

Now that we have set up some peers, you can add them into `config.toml` to sync Dora Vota chain data.

{/* prettier-ignore */}

  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell
  # Comma separated list of seed nodes to connect to
  seeds = "220204926f8da0e197572d458e205608306f1ed1@47.128.207.247:26656,660773dfb97e197e4b300c4cbdb2dff203f78d47@54.151.160.200:26656"
  
  # Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to
  persistent_peers = "220204926f8da0e197572d458e205608306f1ed1@47.128.207.247:26656,660773dfb97e197e4b300c4cbdb2dff203f78d47@54.151.160.200:26656"
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell

  seeds = "1c070c5b38c716370af9b0d344209821cceeceb3@18.142.245.25:26656"
  
  # Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to
  persistent_peers = "1c070c5b38c716370af9b0d344209821cceeceb3@18.142.245.25:26656"
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell
  # Comma separated list of seed nodes to connect to
  seeds = "ceae16d973e8fd77cce67b946a9b6bfdf444f316@3.122.237.115:26656,059e1ec595989c8c4ef3fd3552070f5f93888547@52.59.113.160:26656"
  
  # Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to
  persistent_peers = "ceae16d973e8fd77cce67b946a9b6bfdf444f316@3.122.237.115:26656,059e1ec595989c8c4ef3fd3552070f5f93888547@52.59.113.160:26656"
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The configuration above is mainly used for P2P node discovery. Before starting the node, you can synchronize it to a specified block height using the [snapshot](/docs/vota-devops/snapshot) service. Then, you can synchronize to the latest block using the P2P nodes configured above, which reduces the synchronization time.

## Running `dorad` node service

<Steps>
### Register `dorad` as a `systemd` service

`dorad` should be running at all times. It’s recommended you register `dorad` as a `systemd` service so that it will automatically restart if your system reboots.

### Create the definition file

Create the definition file in `/etc/systemd/system/dorad.service`.

```shell
[Unit]
Description=dora-vota-service
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=<USER>
ExecStart=<PATH_TO_DORAD>/dorad start
RestartSec=10
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=655350

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- `<USER>`: Enter the user (likely your username or root, unless you created a user specifically for `dorad`).
- `<PATH_TO_DORAD>`: Enter the path to the `dorad` executable, which is likely `/home/<YOUR_USER>/go/bin/dorad` or `/usr/go/bin`. Confirm this by checking the location of `dorad`.

### Run the program upon startup

After registering `dorad` as a system service, you can set the program to run upon startup.

```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable dorad
```

### Start the service and check the log

```shell
sudo systemctl start dorad
sudo journalctl -u dorad -f --no-hostname -o cat
```

</Steps>

## Use `dorad` docker image to start node

As an alternative, you can also use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (make sure to install it).

<Callout type="info">
  For Linux users, it’s recommended to run the Docker daemon in [Rootless
  Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless).
</Callout>

### Pull Docker image

You can pull the Docker image from the following repositories image: [dorafactory/doravota](https://hub.docker.com/r/dorafactory/doravota)

For example, to connect to the Dora Vota Mainnet, use the following command:

```shell
docker pull dorafactory/doravota
```

### Set up path

By default, the Docker image runs the `dorad` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `dorad` after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.dora` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.dora:/root/.dora dorafactory/doravota keys add test-key
```

And then list all keys:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.dora:/root/.dora dorafactory/doravota keys list
```

It’s also important to note that, when running a node in a network, you’ll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- `1317`: Rest server
- `26656`: Tendermint P2P
- `26657`: Tendermint RPC

<Callout>
To simplify using the Docker container, you can set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag, like:

```shell
alias dorad="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.dora:/root/.dora dorafactory/doravota"
```

</Callout>

After setting the alias with the above tip, you can use other `dorad` commands without typing the verbose Docker run command. For the sake of comprehensive documentation, the full Docker command is shown. Just remember that by setting the alias you can simply use `dorad` instead of the Docker command.
