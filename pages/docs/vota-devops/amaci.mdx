# How to Run A-MACI Operator Service on `vota-sf` Testnet

## Requirements

### Hardware requirements

- CPU: 8 cores
- Memory: 16 GB
- Disk: 100 GB

### Software requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version: >= 20
- [`dorad`](/docs/vota-dev/dorad) version: 0.4.0

## Create an A-MACI operator account

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you have backed up the **MNEMONIC** of this account which is the
  only method to recover your wallet. Also, it will be used when **initiating
  A-MACI operator service**.
</Callout>

This account will be used later to register as an A-MACI operator.

```sh
export ACCOUNT_NAME=maci-operator
dorad keys add $ACCOUNT_NAME
```

## Register an A-MACI operator on `vota-sf`

<Steps>
### Stake 20 DORA to register as A-MACI operator with your A-MACI operator account:

```sh
dorad tx wasm execute dora17p9rzwnnfxcjp32un9ug7yhhzgtkhvl9jfksztgw5uh69wac2pgsnah3h8 '{"register": {} }' \
--from maci-operator  \
--amount "20000000000000000000peaka" \
--chain-id "vota-sf" \
--gas-prices 100000000000peaka \
--gas auto \
--gas-adjustment 1.5 \
--node https://vota-sf-rpc.dorafactory.org:443 \
-y
```

### Query whether your A-MACI operator has been created successfully

```sh
dorad query wasm contract-state smart dora17p9rzwnnfxcjp32un9ug7yhhzgtkhvl9jfksztgw5uh69wac2pgsnah3h8  '{ "is_maci_operator": { "address": <your_account_address> } }' --node https://vota-sf-rpc.dorafactory.org:443
```

If terminal shows `true`, it means the A-MACI operator creation is successful.

```sh
data: true
```

</Steps>

## Build A-MACI operator service

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DoraFactory/maci-operator && cd maci-operator

npm install

npm run build
```

## Initiate A-MACI operator service

<Callout type="info">
  Before configuring environment variables, please make sure you have navigated
  to the `/maci-operator` directory.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Create your own environment variables file

```sh
cp .env.template .env
```

### Generate your coordinator public and private key

<Callout type="warning">
  Please back up the generated public and private keys.
</Callout>

```sh
node dist/gen-key.js
```

Next, enter the public key into our [coordinator public key collection form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hNlK5qBGrqgZ6UDaLVThjfuvMlX4CsznzWmWCm0QRl0/edit?usp=sharing). For example, the format of the public key:

```sh
X: 16429304017412205675820866000313944904446810339972042319485432996531286181952
Y: 5572999208344294573488778747734990567557173306854827005273539480127951622273
```

### Config your MNEMONIC and coordinator private key

- Enter the mnemonic of the previously generated **A-MACI operator account** into the `MNEMONIC` field in your `.env` file.
- Enter the **coordinator private key** generated in the previous step into the `COORDINATOR_PRI_KEY` field in your `.env` file.

### Initiate A-MACI operator service

```sh
npm run init
```

</Steps>

## Setup A-MACI operator service

<Steps>
### Create the definition file

Create the definition file in `/etc/systemd/system/amaci.service`.

```sh
[Unit]
Description=A-MACI-operator-service
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=<USER>
WorkingDirectory=<PATH_TO_maci-operator>
EnvironmentFile=<PATH_TO_maci-operator>/.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node dist/index.js
RestartSec=10
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=655350

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- `<USER>`: Enter the user (likely your username or root, unless you created a user specifically for A-MACI operator service).
- `<PATH_TO_maci-operator>`: Enter the path to the `maci-operator` directory, which is likely `/home/ubuntu/maci-operator`.

### Run the program upon startup

After registering amaci as a system service, you can set the program to run upon startup.

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable amaci
```

### Start the service and check the log

```sh
sudo systemctl start amaci
sudo journalctl -u amaci -f --no-hostname -o cat
```

If it started successfully, you will see many similar logs like this：

```sh
[DO]: inspect
[TASK inspect] find rounds count: 0/0
[DO]: inspect
[TASK inspect] find rounds count: 0/0
[DO]: inspect
```

</Steps>

## What is the A-MACI operator service doing?

- The A-MACI operator service periodically checks A-MACI rounds that need to be processed on the `vota-sf` testnet.
- The A-MACI operator service logs processed A-MACI round information and other data in the `/maci-operator/work` directory.
