# How to Run aMACI Operator Service on Dora Vota Mainnet (`vota-ash`)

The aMACI operator service is a unique feature offered by the Dora Factory Anonymous MACI protocol (aMACI). Running an aMACI operator means that you will run and tally an aMACI round for a community, and validate the round with zero-knowledge proofs.

The first batch of aMACI opearators will be Dora Vota mainnet validators. From the protocol’s [frontend](https://vota.dorafactory.org/), users will be able to create aMACI rounds and select an aMACI operator.

## Requirements

### Hardware requirements

#### Basic configuration

- CPU: 4 cores
- Memory: 8 GB
- Disk: 256 GB

#### Better configuration

- CPU: 8 cores
- Memory: 16 GB
- Disk: 512 GB

### Software requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version >= 20
- [`dorad`](https://docs.dorafactory.org/docs/vota-dev/dorad) version = 0.4.0

## Create an aMACI operator account

<Callout type="warning">
  We strongly recommend you create a new account which will be used later to
  register as an aMACI operator. It is prohibited to use the validator’s owner
  address as the aMACI operator address, because it may cause the aMACI operator
  to fail to process transactions.
</Callout>

```sh
export AMACI_OPERATOR=amaci-operator
dorad keys add $AMACI_OPERATOR
```

To initiate the operator, please prepare **1,000 DORA** for your operator account to support the service, and monitor the balance of the account in a timely manner. Insufficient balance may affect the operation of the aMACI operator service.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please make sure you have backed up the **MNEMONIC** of this account which is
  the only method to recover it. Also, it will be used when **initiating aMACI
  operator service**.
</Callout>

## Register an aMACI operator on `vota-ash`

Set up your operator with the owner address of your validator on the `vota-ash` network.

- The owner address is the address starting with `dora` prefix used to create your validator. Taking the [DoraFactory validator](https://doravota.explorers.guru/validator/doravaloper1gerunjnh6umehq6zm0gphrc87u37veuv5y9dkw) as an example, its owner address is `dora1gerunjnh6umehq6zm0gphrc87u37veuv8jqmq3`. Please use your validator owner address here to set up your aMACI operator.
- This is the address of the aMACI mainnet contract: `dora1smg5qp5trjdkcekdjssqpjehdjf6n4cjss0clyvqcud3t3u3948s8rmgg4`.

```sh
dorad tx wasm execute dora1smg5qp5trjdkcekdjssqpjehdjf6n4cjss0clyvqcud3t3u3948s8rmgg4 '{"set_maci_operator": { "operator": "<your_operator_address>" } }' \
--from "<your_validator_owner_address>" \
--amount "20000000000000000000peaka" \
--chain-id "vota-ash" \
--gas-prices 100000000000peaka \
--gas auto \
--gas-adjustment 1.5 \
--node https://vota-rpc.dorafactory.org:443 \
-y
```

## Build aMACI operator

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DoraFactory/amaci-operator.git && cd amaci-operator

npm install

npm run build
```

## Configure aMACI operator service

<Steps>
### Configure environment variables

<Callout type="info">
  Please make sure you have navigated to the `/amaci-operator` directory.
</Callout>

#### Step 1: Create your own environment variables file

```sh
cp .env.template .env
```

#### Step 2: Generate your coordinator public and private key

<Callout type="warning">
  Please back up the generated public and private keys.
</Callout>

```sh
node dist/gen-key.js
```

For example, the format of the public key:

```sh
X: 16429304017412205675820866000313944904446810339972042319485432996531286181952
Y: 5572999208344294573488778747734990567557173306854827005273539480127951622273
```

#### Step 3: Configure your MNEMONIC and coordinator private key of aMACI operator

- Enter the **mnemonic** of the previously generated `aMACI operator account` into the `MNEMONIC` field in your `.env` file.
- Enter the **coordinator private key** generated in the previous step into the `COORDINATOR_PRI_KEY` field in your `.env` file.
- Enter the `rpc url`(It ensures that you can use a stable and continuous RPC services, it is recommended that you use your validator RPC or stable full node RPC) into the `RPC_ENDPOINT` field in your `.env` file.

### Set your aMACI operator information

#### Step 1: Set your operator identity by your operator address

<Callout type="info">
  We will use the **Keybase ID** as your operator `identity` here. The Keybase
  ID is a 16-digit string that is generated with a
  [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) account. It’s a cryptographically secure
  method of verifying your identity across multiple online networks. The Keybase
  API allows us to retrieve your Keybase avatar and other public info.
</Callout>

```sh
dorad tx wasm execute  dora1smg5qp5trjdkcekdjssqpjehdjf6n4cjss0clyvqcud3t3u3948s8rmgg4 '{"set_maci_operator_identity": { "identity": "<your_identity_id>" } }' \
--from $AMACI_OPERATOR \
--chain-id "vota-ash" \
--gas-prices 100000000000peaka \
--gas auto \
--gas-adjustment 1.5 \
--node https://vota-rpc.dorafactory.org:443 \
-y
```

#### Step 2: Set your operator public key by your operator address

```sh
dorad tx wasm execute dora1smg5qp5trjdkcekdjssqpjehdjf6n4cjss0clyvqcud3t3u3948s8rmgg4 '{"set_maci_operator_pubkey": { "pubkey": { "x": "<your_pubkey_x>", "y": "<your_pubkey_y>"  }} }' \
--from $AMACI_OPERATOR \
--chain-id "vota-ash" \
--gas-prices 100000000000peaka \
--gas auto \
--gas-adjustment 1.5 \
--node https://vota-rpc.dorafactory.org:443 \
-y
```

### Initiate aMACI operator service

```sh
npm run init
```

</Steps>

## Setup aMACI operator service

<Steps>
### Create the definition file

Create the definition file in `/etc/systemd/system/amaci.service`.

```sh
[Unit]
Description=aMACI-operator-service
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=<USER>
WorkingDirectory=<PATH_TO_amaci-operator>
EnvironmentFile=<PATH_TO_amaci-operator>/.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node dist/index.js
RestartSec=10
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=655350

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- `<USER>`: Enter the user (likely your username or root, unless you created a user specifically for aMACI operator service).
- `<PATH_TO_amaci-operator>`: Enter the path to the `amaci-operator` directory, which is likely `/home/ubuntu/amaci-operator`.

### Run the program upon startup

After registering `amaci` as a system service, you can set the program to run upon startup.

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable amaci
```

### Start the service and check the log

```sh
sudo systemctl start amaci
sudo journalctl -u amaci -f --no-hostname -o cat
```

If the service started successfully, the log will output your aMACI operator’s information and download some necessary zkey files. Like this:

```sh
Started A-MACI-operator-service.
Init
Coordinator public key:

## What is the aMACI operator service doing?

- The aMACI operator service periodically checks aMACI rounds that need to be processed on the `vota-ash` mainnet.
- The aMACI operator service logs processed aMACI round information and other data in the `/amaci-operator/work` directory.
