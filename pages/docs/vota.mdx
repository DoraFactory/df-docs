# Dora Vota Operator Manual

[Dora Vota](https://research.dorahacks.io/2023/07/31/vota) is a specialized blockchain for voting and decentralized community governance.

Dora Vota is going to support voting rounds for various communities and organizations. The first voting scheme we support is MACI (Minimal Anti-collusion Infrastructure).

In order to allow everyone to setup and apply MACI easily, Dora Factory has developed a user-friendly [GUI](https://vota.dorafactory.org) and [CLI](https://github.com/DoraFactory/vota-operator-scripts) for MACI voting round deployment and operation.

If you're interested in the mechanisms and details of MACI, you can explore further by reading the following articles:
