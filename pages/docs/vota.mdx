# Vota Operator’s Manual

[Dora Vota](https://vota.dorafactory.org/) is a specialized blockchain for voting and decentralized community governance.

Dora Factory has developed a user-friendly [GUI](https://vota.dorafactory.org/) and [CLI](https://github.com/DoraFactory/vota-operator-scripts) for MACI (Minimal Anti-collusion Infrastructure) voting round deployment and operation.

If you're interested in the mechanisms and details of MACI, you can explore further by reading “[Light-weight MACI Anonymization](https://research.dorahacks.io/2022/04/30/light-weight-maci-anonymization/)”.
