# Prerequisites

## Prepare a wallet for aMACI admin

To facilitate safe and seamless aMACI round deployment and admin, you can set up your wallet by following the steps below:

<Steps>

### Keplr wallet

- Get the Keplr browser extension from [the official channel](https://www.keplr.app/download).
- Create a new account by following [the official guide](https://www.keplr.app/onboarding/how-to-create).

  accessible on Keplr wallet mobile app.
</Callout>

### Dora Vota Mainnet address

- Add [Dora Vota Mainnet](https://vota-explorer.dorafactory.org/wallet/keplr) to your Keplr wallet.
- Your Dora Vota Mainnet address will be generated automatically in your wallet.

### Sufficient DORA tokens

- Get sufficient DORA tokens for gas fees, which will be consumed in the deployment and admin. To start with, we recommend you prepare 5 DORA.
- Please keep in mind that you should acquire DORA tokens on the **Dora Vota Mainnet**.

<Callout type="info">
