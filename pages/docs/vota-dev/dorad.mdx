# Get Started with `dorad`

After installing the `dorad` binary, you will be able to interact with the Dora Vota Mainnet via CLI.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have correctly installed [all the dependencies](/docs/vota-dev/dependencies) on your system.

## Setup

`dorad` is a command-line tool to interact with the [Dora Vota](https://vota-explorer.dorafactory.org/) blockchain.

To install `dorad`, find the correct [version tag](https://github.com/DoraFactory/doravota/tags), and run the following commands:

```ansi filename="Terminal"
$ git clone https://github.com/DoraFactory/doravota.git
$ cd doravota
$ git checkout <version tag>
$ make install
$ sudo cp ~/go/bin/dorad /usr/local/bin
```

You can verify that dorad was installed properly by running:

```ansi filename="Terminal"

## Create a Dora Vota account with `dorad`

<Steps>
### Add a named Vota account [#dorad-keys-add]

During the following process, you will be asked to set a passphrase for your account. Once successfully created, the terminal will output a series of **mnemonic words**.

```ansi {12} filename="Terminal"
[0m$ dorad keys add <name of key>
[0;90mEnter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):
Re-enter keyring passphrase:
- address: dora14wk0kv0cr59ml0xkww48gncd25ljtzfpjrpvx9
  name: temp-account
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AzBjp4HCkacaoSjvWLda9EuqDWQPjPVsIEZojURqgDFg"}'
  type: local

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

  Please make sure to keep these **mnemonic words** in a secure place, do not
  lose it, and do not leak it, as they are crucial for recovering your account.
</Callout>

## Transfer and query using the `bank` module

### Token in Dora Vota

The denom of Dora Vota is `peaka`, and `1 DORA = 10^18 peaka`.

### Transfer between addresses

- `from_addr`: source address of this transfer transaction
- `to_addr`: destination address of this transfer transaction
- `amount`: you can use `peaka` or `DORA` which depends on the amount youâ€™re transferring.

Here is an example of token transfer on Dora Vota:

```ansi filename="Terminal"
$ dorad tx bank send <from_addr> <to_addr> <amount> --chain-id vota-ash --gas-prices=100000000000peaka --gas=auto --gas-adjustment=1.5 --node https://vota-rpc.dorafactory.org:443
```

### Query the balance of account

You can use this command to query the balance of a specific account address.

```ansi filename="Terminal"
$ dorad query bank balances <account_address> --node https://vota-rpc.dorafactory.org:443
```
