# Dora Token Mainnet Migration Tutorial

Migrating your Ethereum [ERC-20 DORA tokens](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4957805230831401CaaD5b690AA138143B711358) (ethDORA) from Ethereum to the Dora Vota appchain will enable you to use DORA tokens as utilities in a much wider range of applications, including staking your token to secure the network, participate in appchain-level governance, public good funding, use native DORA tokens in various decentralized governance use cases, such as MACI/aMACI voting rounds, and direct democracy across the Cosmos appchain ecosystem.

- Step 1 — Enter [Migration Portal](https://vota-migration.dorafactory.org) and read important terms in the user agreement and privacy policy.
- Step 2 — Connect a wallet holding Ethereum ERC-20 DORA tokens.
- Step 3 — Enter the amount of ethDORA tokens to migrate.
- Step 4 — Type in a recipient address to migrate to on the Dora Vota appchain.
- Step 5 — Preview migration details.
- Step 6 — Confirm migration by signing with wallet.
- Step 7 — Check the status of your migration and eventually receive native DORA tokens on the Dora Vota appchain network.

<Steps>
### Visit [Migration Portal](https://vota-migration.dorafactory.org) to initiate the migration process

Dora Factory has provided a Migration Portal ([vota-migration.dorafactory.org](https://vota-migration.dorafactory.org)) as an official user interface that facilitates the migration of ethDORA tokens from Ethereum to the Dora Vota appchain via the ethDORA Migration Smart Contract (Ethereum address: [`0xe4aa3d3282aE54a8677B93885d4e3B8285cCdD6b`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4aa3d3282aE54a8677B93885d4e3B8285cCdD6b)).

### Connect a wallet holding ethDORA

1. Acknowledge the terms before proceeding to access the interface.

### Check status of your migration

1. After the transaction finalizing time on the Ethereum network has elapsed, you will find the pending migration in the **“Pending Migrations”** tab.

2. In order for you to better understand some values from this table, it is recommended that you click **“View More”** to see more explanations.

3. You can filter the table by pasting your Dora Vota apphain address to see all of your pending migration transactions or click the **“Mine”** sub-tab to see your transaction only.

</Steps>

## Other notes

Once the pending migration transaction has been settled on the Dora Vota appchain, you will no longer see a pending migration transaction from the pending transaction list. You can refresh the page to initiate a new migration transaction.

The corresponding amount of tokens will be sent to the Dora Vota address provided by you through the migration process.

<Callout type="info">
  Please note that all migration tokens will be sent from the following Dora
  Vota address:
  [`dora1vuzwcykp5zc7phvxasynfjkv6vh6dcyhgzm6wv`](https://vota-explorer.dorafactory.org/doravota/account/dora1vuzwcykp5zc7phvxasynfjkv6vh6dcyhgzm6wv).

The Dora Vota mainnet’s chain ID is `vota-ash`. The mainnet becomes official once the token migration process is launched. There are two popular blockchain explorers for the Dora Vota mainnet at this moment:

- [PingPub explorer](https://vota-explorer.dorafactory.org)
- [NodeGuru explorer](https://doravota.explorers.guru)
