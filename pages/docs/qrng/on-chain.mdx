# On-chain Faucet

## Introduction

The QRNG Oracle is divided into two main components: one is the random number request, and the other is the random number backfill interface.

Users can request random numbers by calling the request component of the [`QrngCoordinator.sol`](https://github.com/DoraFactory/DI-QRNG-Faucet/blob/main/contracts/QrngCoordinator.sol) contract.

An off-chain process listens for these random number requests and subsequently backfills the corresponding quantity of random numbers into the designated contract.

In regards to the backfilling of random numbers, users should implement a fulfill method based the [`ConsumerBase.sol`](https://github.com/DoraFactory/DI-QRNG-Faucet/blob/main/contracts/ConsumerBase.sol) contract The internal logic for processing random numbers can be customized according to user needs.

## How to use

```solidity filename="Demo"
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

// Import the official contract
import "./QrngCoordinator.sol";
import "./ConsumerBase.sol";

contract QrngUserDemo is ConsumerBase {
  // Set the maximum gas that can be used by oracle under the chain.
  uint32 callbackGasLimit = 80_000;
  // Set the number of qrng random numbers to request
  uint32 numWords = 1;
  address owner;

  QrngCoordinator COORDINATOR;

  // Official QrngCoordinator's contract address
  address doraCoordinatorAddr = 0x7156e92AF2d3DEeC0F04E3e321226389D16F6e93;

  uint256 public requestId;
  uint256[] public s_randomWords;

  constructor() ConsumerBase(doraCoordinatorAddr)  {
    COORDINATOR = QrngCoordinator(doraCoordinatorAddr);
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function requestRandomWords() external {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(
      callbackGasLimit,
      numWords
    );
  }

  function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {
    s_randomWords = randomWords;
  }
}
```
