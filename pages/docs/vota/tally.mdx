# Tally and Proof

The tally and proof process for each MACI round begins at the ending of the voting period.

## Configure `credential.env` file

<Callout type="warning">
  Please ensure that the credential.env file remains confidential and prevent
  from committing this file to your git repository.
</Callout>

Before starting the tally and proof operation, you need to properly configure the `credential.env` file.

- **Contract address**, which can be found and copied from the Dora Vota website.
- **Operator’s private key**, which has been generated from the [previous step](/docs/vota/deploy#generating-keys-for-operator).
- **Mnemonic of operator’s Keplr wallet**, which can found and copied from the Keplr wallet. For more help, check out the [Keplr’s official guide](https://help.keplr.app/articles/how-to-view-your-seed-phrase).

```bash filename="credential.env"
# Contract address of your MACI round
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=dora1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdefghijklm

# Operator's prviate key
COORDINATOR_KEY=12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567

# Mnemonic of operator's Keplr wallet
MNEMONIC='lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit donec scelerisque ante non'
```

## Tally and proof automatically

For smooth and uninterrupted operations, ensure you have:

- Stable internet connectivity.
- Enough DORA tokens to cover gas fees.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run tally
```

The entire process will take some time, depending on the amount of signups and voting messages in your MACI round. Once the process successfully completes, your tally results will be automatically verified and published on the Dora Vota blockchain.
