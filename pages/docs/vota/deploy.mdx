## Deploying a round on Dora Vota

You can easily deploy a new round via the GUI on the Dora Vota website:

<a
  className="mt-3 block"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://vota.dorafactory.org/?action=deploy"
>
  ![](/assets/button-deploy-maci.svg)
</a>

### Creating and deploying

1. Follow the steps on the GUI to fill the required information, during which you will be asked to input the **operator’s public key** generated above.
2. Send the transaction to deploy through the Keplr wallet extension. Make sure you have **sufficient DORA tokens** in your wallet account as gas fee.
3. After waiting a few seconds for successful deployment, you can find your round on the website.

### About MACI signup allowlist

You can [download the template](/download/maci-allowlist.csv) of the MACI signup allowlist. The allowlist is a CSV file with two columns:

- The first column is the address of the voter, which must be a valid Dora Vota Mainnet address.
- The second column is the amount of voice credits each voter will be assigned, which must be a positive integer.

```csv filename="maci-allowlist.csv"
dora1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123, 100
```

### Maintaining the round information

By clicking the ⚙️ button on the page of round details, you can find the entries for the information editing:

- **Voting options**: It is recommended to assign semantic names to the voting options _before the round starts_, which will be displayed for the voters.
- **Round information**: You can update the title, description, and related link of the round at any time.
