## Deploy a voting round on Dora Vota

You can easily deploy a new round via the GUI on the Dora Vota website:

<a
  className="mt-3 block"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://vota.dorafactory.org/?action=deploy"
>
  ![Deploy MACI](/assets/button-deploy-maci.svg)
</a>

### Create and deploy a round

1. Follow the steps on the GUI to fill the required information, during which you will be asked to input the **operator’s public key** generated above.
2. Send the transaction to deploy through the Keplr wallet extension. Make sure you have **sufficient DORA tokens** in your wallet account as gas fee.
3. After waiting a few seconds for successful deployment, you can find your round on the website.
