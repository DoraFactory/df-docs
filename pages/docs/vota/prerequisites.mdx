# Prerequisites

## Set up a reliable environment

For optimal performance and security, it is recommended to prepare an environment with:

- **Stable internet**: Ensure reliable connectivity.
- **Secure computing platform**: Maintain a safe and robust computer environment.
- **UNIX-like OS with a terminal app/emulator**: macOS, Linux, or similar systems are recommended for better compatibility with Node.js and CLI operations.

## Install Node.js 18.x version

Visit the Node.js official [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to get the latest 18.x (currently LTS) version for your platform.

The `npm` (Node Package Manager) CLI tool will be included in the Node.js installation.

## Prepare a wallet for operation

To facilitate safe and seamless operations, you can set up your wallet by following the steps below:

<Steps>

### Keplr wallet

<Callout type="warning">
  Please keep in mind that a Keplr wallet **with mnemonic phrase** is necessary
  for Vota’s MACI operation. For more information, check out [Keplr’s official
  guide](https://help.keplr.app/articles/four-ways-to-create-a-keplr-account).
</Callout>

- Get the Keplr browser extension from [the official channel](https://www.keplr.app/download).
- Create a new account **via mnemonic phrase**, or import an existing one **via mnemonic phrase**.
- A dedicated wallet account, used exclusively for MACI operations, is recommended.

### Dora Vota Mainnet address

- Add [Dora Vota Mainnet](https://vota-explorer.dorafactory.org/wallet/keplr) to your Keplr wallet.
- Your Dora Vota Mainnet address will be generated automatically in your wallet.

### Sufficient DORA tokens

- Get sufficient DORA tokens for gas fees, which will be consumed in the operation process. To start with, we recommend you prepare 5 DORA.
- Please keep in mind that you should acquire DORA tokens on the **Dora Vota Mainnet**.

<Callout type="default">
  Currently, you can request a few DORA tokens from the [faucet of Dora Vota
  Mainnet](https://dorahacks.io/faucet).
</Callout>

</Steps>
