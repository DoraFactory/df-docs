## Create a DearDoge address with `dogd`

<Steps>
### Add a named Dear Doge account

During the following process, you will be asked to set a passphrase for your account. Once successfully created, the terminal will output a series of mnemonic words.

```ansi filename="Terminal"
[0m$ dogd keys add <name of key>
[0;90m- address: deardoge10lqthwsz3v54r6ys89v49hy0pgh09ksdlajkuq
  name: aaa
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A/0ut8HT+hVO+Z1o/jIxWpvR6iVootcaW+Gjkv8zDfF7"}'
  type: local

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

**faculty will pioneer budget monkey hill despair like prevent hunt spot apart confirm cave physical swap mixture cube fantasy find frequent key sudden flush**
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Please make sure to keep these **mnemonic words** in a secure place, do not
  lose it, and do not leak it, as they are crucial for recovering your account.
</Callout>

### Show account details

```ansi filename="Terminal"
[0m$ dogd keys list
[0;90m- address: deardoge10lqthwsz3v54r6ys89v49hy0pgh09ksdlajkuq
  name: temp-account
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A/0ut8HT+hVO+Z1o/jIxWpvR6iVootcaW+Gjkv8zDfF7"}'
  type: local
```

</Steps>

## Transfer and query using the `bank` module

### Token of DearDoge testnet

The denom of Dear Doge testnet is `dear`, and `1 dear = 10^6 udear`.

### Transfer between addresses

- `from_addr`: source address of this transfer transaction.
- `to_addr`: destination address of this transfer transaction.
- `amount`: you can use `udear` or `dear` which depends on the amount youâ€™re transferring.

Here is an example of token transfer on Dear doge:

```ansi filename="Terminal"
$ dogd tx bank send <from_addr> <to_addr> <amount> --chain-id deardoge-testnet --gas-prices=0.25udear --gas=auto --gas-adjustment=1.5 --node https://doge-testnet-rpc.dorafactory.org:443
```

### Query the balance of account

You can use this command to query the balance of a specific account address.

```ansi filename="Terminal"
$ dogd query bank balances <account_address> --node https://doge-testnet-rpc.dorafactory.org:443
```
